## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is required in a wide range of applications. This project has three main objectives:

1. **Finding the Best Sorting Algorithm**: Our sorting algorithm selection tool analyzes the given dataset and recommends the most efficient sorting algorithm based on the data's characteristics. This tool is essential for optimizing sorting operations in real-world applications.

2. **Custom Sort Algorithm - MySuperSort**: In addition to benchmarking various sorting algorithms, we have created our custom sorting algorithm, MySuperSort, which has consistently outperformed Java's built-in sorting method across a range of datasets.

3. **Performance**: The performance of different sorting algorithms has been evaluated on various datasets. We have included detailed performance metrics and comparisons in the `performance_report.pdf` file. You can find information about the sorting algorithms tested, their time complexity, and how they performed on different data types and sizes.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/kasra-sia/MySuperSort.git

## Finding the Best Sorting Algorithm
Our sorting algorithm selection tool, integrated into the benchmarking process, analyzes the characteristics of the input data and recommends the most suitable sorting algorithm. This tool is crucial for achieving optimal sorting performance in diverse scenarios.

## Custom Sort Algorithm - MySuperSort
MySuperSort is our proprietary sorting algorithm designed to outperform Java's built-in sorting method. You can find the source code and documentation for MySuperSort in the MySuperSort.py file. We encourage you to explore this algorithm and consider its use in your projects.

## Performance
The performance of different sorting algorithms has been evaluated on various datasets. We have included detailed performance metrics and comparisons in the performance_report.pdf file. You can find information about the sorting algorithms tested, their time complexity, and how they performed on different data types and sizes.
