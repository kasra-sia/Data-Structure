## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is required in a wide range of applications. This project has three main objectives:

1. **Finding the Best Sorting Algorithm**: Our sorting algorithm selection tool analyzes the given dataset and recommends the most efficient sorting algorithm based on the data's characteristics. This tool is essential for optimizing sorting operations in real-world applications.

2. **Custom Sort Algorithm - MySuperSort**: In addition to benchmarking various sorting algorithms, we have created our custom sorting algorithm, MySuperSort, which has consistently outperformed Java's built-in sorting method across a range of datasets.

3. **Performance**: The performance of different sorting algorithms has been evaluated on various datasets. We have included detailed performance metrics and comparisons in the `performance_report.pdf` file. You can find information about the sorting algorithms tested, their time complexity, and how they performed on different data types and sizes.
